Metaphorically, of course. Unless you want to build a tiny house.<br><br>
While "procrastinating" at work, I came across this <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">series of articles on procrastinating</a>. His idea of progress via incremental steps sounded interesting, and inspired me to take action.<br><br>

Anyway, I came up with an idea for a sort of goals/habits initiative. In the second article the author talks about procrastinators only seeing the final goal (which is daunting), and not seeing the intermediate steps you need to take to get there.<br><br>

<i>A remarkable, glorious achievement is just what a long series of unremarkable, unglorious tasks looks like from far away.</i><br><br>

No one "builds a house." They lay one brick again and again and again and the end result is a house. Procrastinators are great visionaries-they love to fantasize about the beautiful mansion they will one day have built-but what they need to be are gritty construction workers, who methodically lay one brick after the other, day after day, without giving up, until a house is built<br><br>

Nearly every big undertaking can be boiled down to a core unit of progress-its brick. A 45-minute gym visit is the brick of getting in great shape. A 30-minute practice session is the brick of becoming a great guitarist.<br><br>

The average day in a wannabe author's week and a real author's week looks almost the same. The real author writes a couple pages, laying a brick, and the wannabe author writes nothing. 98% of their day is otherwise identical. But a year later, the real author has a completed first draft of a book and the wannabe author has...nothing.<br>

The idea I had is to combine this with the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>, which claims to help eliminate the feeling of burnout. The concept of Pomodoro is summarized as such:<br><br>

<ul>
	<li>25 min of uninterrupted work</li>
	<li>5 min break doing something that doesn't take a lot of mind power. Getting up and moving around is ideal</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2</li>
	<li>If you go more than 4 sessions, take a longer (30+ min) break after each 4th session</li>
</ul><br>

So let's lay 100 bricks this summer. Start today. By the end of July, go through the 25/5 sequence at least 100 times focused on something important you want to work on. If you finish earlier, keep going and see how many you can lay before the end of July.

Here are a few more details:<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>Write down a prioritized list of things you want to work on. Work on it from top to bottom. Make sure the goal is broken down into small enough steps that you can measure progress. Read the procrastination article if you haven't already to get an idea of what the right scope is.</li>
	<li>Only re-prioritize your list after each 25 bricks.</li>
	<li>Every day that you lay at least one brick, write a short (~2 sentences) progress note of what you accomplished. Always make these positive notes. Never say "accomplished nothing". These can be public or private, but this is not optional.</li>
</ul>
