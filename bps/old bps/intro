This is my first post on the blog, so I'll start off with why I'm making this and how.

I created this blog using google app engine. I took the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253">Web Development</a> class on Udacity which used this tool as well. I'm still very green in the web development game, so things may not always work they way they are supposed to or be up to standard conventions. Hopefully through continuous improvement I'll get a bit closer.

As far as what to expect on this site; right now I plan to use this mainly just for me. I'll link a good article I read with my analysis for later reflection. I might link good new music that I currently have on repeat, or books that I found worthy of comment. This will also be used as a test site for anything new I'm learning with web development or technology related.

I haven't built in a comments system yet, but if you do happen to stumble across this site and have any comments or suggestions about anything, feel free to reach out with the contact info on the right.
