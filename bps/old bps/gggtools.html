For the hosting of the site, as well as the database management, we're using <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a>. The code that powers the back-end is python. As I mentioned in the intro post, we used these tools in the Udacity web development class. I really like python. It seems like a light-weight, yet powerful, language that has a lot of available libraries already created. It has lots of documentation online about the best ways to do things, which has helped me learn a lot very quickly.<br><br>

Within google app engine, we use a tool called <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">jinja2</a> which is a 'templating' language. What this does is allow you to create dynamic html documents by passing data from the back-end to display in the web browser. For example, I'm using a for loop inside the HTML document to print my blog posts. You simply pass the list of blog posts, and jinja2 uses the database to grab the content and then builds out your html file to pass to the browser. It's a pretty neat tool, and works really well so far.<br><br>

On the front end, I haven't done a whole lot yet. I threw on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to make it look passable, but otherwise it's pretty vanilla so far. I'm hoping Brandon has some ideas on cool things to do on the front-end that we can work on implementing together.<br><br>

I also have my code on <a href="https://github.com/crazcarl/gridironguessinggame">GitHub</a>, and we'll be tracking our changes through there. Until now, I've really only used GitHub as a way to push code and then kind of forget about it. I didn't really every use it as version control. Just yesterday for the first time I created a new branch to fix some styling issues and did a pull request to merge the two branches together. Pretty exciting stuff! As Brandon gets up to speed, I'm looking forward to learning more about having two (or more) people collaborate on a project and how Git and GitHub help with that.<br><br>

That's all for now. I'll give another update as we progress on the site or encounter anything cool.
