While I was going through the Udacity course on web development, I was looking for a way to put my newly minted skills to good use. One of my friends Brandon runs a pool with friends and family where everyone picks who they think will win each week based on the spread. He currently runs it by email and spreadsheet, and I thought it would be cool to turn it into a web app. I originally wasn't planning on trying to get him to use it, it was more just to help reinforce the contents of the course. I recently showed him what I had come up with, and he seemed pretty excited about it, and is on board with helping me get it ready for next season.<br><br>

The basic outline of how the system works is like this:
<ol>
	<li>Brandon emails out the schedule of games with the spread in a MS Word document</li>
	<li>People fill out the document and send it back before the first game starts</li>
	<li>Once all the picks are submitted, Brandon sends out a file of eveyone's picks</li>
	<li>After the final game is complete, Brandon checks everyone's picks and sends out the results in a spreadsheet that tracks the weekly winner as well as the overall winner</li>
</ol>

We still have a lot to do, but I'm looking forward to working with Brandon on this. If you want to check out the site right now, it's online at <a href="http://gridironguessinggame.appspot.com">Grid Iron Guessing Game</a>. The next post will be more about the tools we'll be using and how we're collaborating on the project.
